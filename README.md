# These are the source codes for Milestone 3 of our project, frame interpolation.

## Notice

Please note that to run any of the source codes, other folders and files are required. 
Nevertheless, due to the size limit of gitHub, we only provide python source codes.

On your request, we will send such additional required data, obtained from YOLO v3, SuperSloMo, and Openpose.
